## Required Illustration: Pi Blob

### File: `pi-blob.svg` (or `pi-blob.png`)

**What to create:** A friendly blue blob character

**Style Guidelines:**
- Soft, rounded blob shape (like a friendly cloud or gummy bear)
- Warm blue color (not cold tech blue)
  - Main blob: #7EB5E8 (warm sky blue)
  - Darker shading: #5A9BD5
  - Eyes/mouth: #4A4035 (warm dark)
- Simple friendly face: two dots for eyes, gentle smile
- Hand-drawn/sketch quality (slightly imperfect lines)
- No arms/legs - just an expressive blob

**Dimensions:**
- Canvas: 400x400px at 2x resolution (800x800px actual)
- Blob fills ~75% of canvas
- Leave breathing room around edges for glow effects

**Export:**
- SVG preferred (scalable, small file size)
- OR PNG with transparency at 2x resolution
- File size: Keep under 100KB

**Drawing Tips:**
1. Open Procreate, Figma, or even paper + scan
2. Draw a soft, rounded blob shape (like ☁️ but more solid)
3. Add two small dots for eyes
4. Add a gentle curved smile
5. Make the outline slightly wobbly (hand-drawn feel)
6. Fill with gradient: #7EB5E8 → #5A9BD5
7. Add optional shading with darker blue
8. Export as SVG or PNG with transparent background

**Time estimate:** 10-15 minutes!

## Fallback

If the image isn't found, the app will show a temporary emoji-based fallback (🤖), so the app won't break. But the custom blob will look much better!

## Future Assets (Optional)

When ready to expand:
- Background layers (cozy room elements)
- Decorative frames for workspace
- Custom sparkle variations
- Seasonal themes

But for now, just the Pi blob is perfect!
