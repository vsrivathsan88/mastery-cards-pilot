# Understanding-to-Mastery Assessment Protocol

## Problem with Keywords
Keyword matching is too shallow:
- ❌ Measures vocabulary, not comprehension
- ❌ False positives: Says "equal" but doesn't know what it means
- ❌ False negatives: Understands but uses different words
- ❌ Can't assess depth, reasoning, or transfer

## New Approach: Two-Question Protocol

### The Protocol

**Q1: OBSERVATION** (Open)
"What do you notice about [the image]?"
→ See what they identify WITHOUT prompting

**Q2: EXPLANATION** (Probing)
"Why is that?" / "Tell me more" / "What makes you say that?"
→ Check if they can EXPLAIN their thinking

**JUDGE**: After two questions, evaluate:
- Did they identify key concepts? (observation)
- Can they explain WHY or HOW? (reasoning)
- Does explanation connect to mastery goal?

**Q3: FINAL MASTERY CHECK** (If unclear)
Direct test question:
- "If one was bigger, would they still be equal?"
- "Would this work with different sizes?"
→ YES/NO answer reveals understanding

### Three Outcomes

**✅ MASTERY ACHIEVED**:
- Identified concepts correctly (Q1)
- Explained reasoning clearly (Q2)
- → Award points + Next card

**❓ UNDERSTANDING UNCLEAR**:
- Got part of it, but vague or incomplete
- → Ask final mastery check (Q3)
- → Then decide based on answer

**❌ NO UNDERSTANDING**:
- Off-topic, guessing, or can't explain after 3 tries
- → Move on without points

## Example Flows

### GOOD FLOW - Clear Mastery ✅

**Card 1: Equal Cookies**
- Mastery Goal: Recognize equal groups

Q1: "What do you notice about these cookies?"
A1: "There are four cookies"

Q2: "Tell me more about those four cookies"
A2: "They're all the same size"

**Judge**: 
- ✓ Identified quantity (four)
- ✓ Identified equality (same size)
- ✓ Explained when probed
= **MASTERY ✅**

**Action**: "Nice! Four equal cookies!" + award 30pts + next card

---

### UNCLEAR FLOW - Needs Final Check ❓

Q1: "What do you notice?"
A1: "Cookies"

Q2: "What about them?"
A2: "They look yummy"

**Judge**: Too vague, not addressing concept ❓

Q3 (Final Check): "If one cookie was huge and others tiny, would that be the same as this?"
A3: "No, because these are all equal"

**Judge**: NOW showed understanding! **MASTERY ✅**

**Action**: "Exactly!" + award 30pts + next card

---

### NO MASTERY FLOW ❌

Q1: "What do you notice?"
A1: "I don't know"

Q2: "Look at the cookies - what do you see?"
A2: "They're round"

Q3 (Final Check): "Are these the same size or different sizes?"
A3: "Different?" (guessing)

**Judge**: After 3 tries, not demonstrating concept **NO MASTERY ❌**

**Action**: "Let's try another one!" + next card (no points)

## What This Assesses

Not just vocabulary, but:
- **Recognition**: Can they identify the concept?
- **Explanation**: Can they articulate WHY?
- **Reasoning**: Do they understand the relationship?
- **Application**: Can they answer test questions?

## Maximum 3 Questions Per Card

1. Observation (always)
2. Explanation (always)
3. Final check (only if unclear)

Then MUST make decision and move forward. No endless probing.

## Benefits

✅ Assesses actual understanding, not parroting
✅ Checks for reasoning ability  
✅ Natural conversation flow
✅ Can detect partial understanding
✅ Direct test for unclear cases
✅ Keeps session moving (max 3 questions)

## Mastery Criteria

For each card, judge against:
- Did they identify what's important in the image?
- Can they explain the mathematical relationship?
- Do they understand why it matters?

This is understanding-to-mastery, not vocabulary matching.
