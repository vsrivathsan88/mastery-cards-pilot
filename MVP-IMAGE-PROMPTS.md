## Card 1: Equal Cookies (Prerequisites - 30 points)

**Context:** Snack time at school  
**Learning Goal:** Recognize equal groups and one-to-one correspondence

**Image Prompt:**
```
Photograph-style image showing a white ceramic plate on a light wooden table. On the plate are 4 identical chocolate chip cookies, arranged in a square pattern with equal spacing between them. The cookies are round, golden-brown, with visible chocolate chips. Natural lighting from a window creates soft shadows. The image should be taken from a 45-degree angle to show depth. Include a subtle pattern on the plate edge for visual interest.
```

**Pi's Starting Question:** "What do you notice about these cookies?"

**Milestones:**
- Basic (30 pts): Student notices 4 cookies that look the same size

## Card 4: Brownie Halves (Introduction - 50+30 points)

**Context:** Dessert sharing  
**Learning Goal:** Introduction to the term 'one half' as 1 equal part of 2

**Image Prompt:**
```
Photograph of a rectangular chocolate brownie (6 inches x 4 inches) on a white square plate. The brownie has a single straight cut line down the exact center lengthwise, creating two equal rectangular pieces. Each piece is 3 inches x 4 inches. The brownie has a rich chocolate color with a slightly cracked top surface and visible texture. The two pieces are separated by about 1/4 inch to clearly show they are two parts. Soft overhead lighting creates gentle shadows.
```

**Pi's Starting Question:** "This brownie was split. What can you tell Pi about the two pieces?"

**Milestones:**
- Basic (50 pts): Student describes two equal pieces
- Advanced (30 pts): Student uses or understands "half" or "one half"

---

## Card 7: Fraction Strip - Halves (Unit Fractions - 40 points)

**Context:** Measuring ribbon for gift wrapping  
**Learning Goal:** Understand 1/2 as the quantity formed by 1 part when a whole is partitioned into 2 equal parts

**Image Prompt:**
```
Photograph of a rectangular strip of ribbon (12 inches long, 2 inches wide) on a white background. The ribbon is teal blue with a subtle satin sheen. There is one vertical line marked exactly in the center (at 6 inches), dividing the ribbon into 2 equal sections. Each section is 6 inches long. Above the ribbon, there are small measurement marks at 0, 6, and 12 inches. The left section has a small label that reads '1/2'. The photograph is taken from directly above with even lighting.
```

**Pi's Starting Question:** "Pi sees a ribbon cut in half. Can you explain what '1/2' means here?"

**Milestones:**
- Basic (40 pts): Student explains what 1/2 represents as "one of the two pieces"

---

## Card 8: Fraction Circle - Thirds (Unit Fractions - 40 points)

**Context:** Sharing a pancake  
**Learning Goal:** Understand 1/3 as the quantity formed by 1 part when a whole is partitioned into 3 equal parts

**Image Prompt:**
```
Top-down photograph of a circular pancake (8 inches diameter) on a white plate. The pancake has a golden-brown color with visible bubbles and slight caramelization. Two straight cuts from the center to the edge divide the pancake into 3 equal triangular sections (120 degrees each). One section has a small flag or toothpick label reading '1/3'. The sections are still arranged in their original circular formation with small visible gaps between them (1/4 inch) to show the divisions. Soft natural lighting creates gentle shadows.
```

**Pi's Starting Question:** "Three friends are sharing this pancake. What does the '1/3' label tell us?"

**Milestones:**
- Basic (40 pts): Student explains 1/3 means one of those parts

---

## Card 10: Two Thirds of a Pizza (Non-Unit - 50+40 points)

**Context:** Pizza party  
**Learning Goal:** Understand 2/3 as the quantity formed by 2 parts when a whole is partitioned into 3 equal parts

**Image Prompt:**
```
Overhead photograph of a circular pizza (12 inches diameter) on a round wooden board. The pizza is divided into 6 equal triangular slices. Two of the slices remain in place, showing melted cheese, pepperoni, and visible texture. One slice space is empty (removed), creating a visible wedge-shaped gap. The two remaining slices together form about 240 degrees of the circle. A small label near the pizza reads '5/6'. The lighting emphasizes the 3D texture of the remaining slices and the empty space.
```

**Pi's Starting Question:** "Someone ate one slice of this pizza. What fraction is left?"

**Milestones:**
- Basic (50 pts): Student identifies 5 pieces remaining out of 6 total
- Advanced (40 pts): Student explains what 5/6 means or connects to unit fractions

---

## Card 11: Three Fourths of a Garden (Non-Unit - 50 points)

**Context:** Planting flowers  
**Learning Goal:** Understand 3/4 as the quantity formed by 3 parts when a whole is partitioned into 4 equal parts

**Image Prompt:**
```
Top-down photograph of a square raised garden bed (4 feet x 4 feet) divided into 4 equal square sections by two intersecting wooden dividers. Three of the sections contain planted flowers (red tulips, yellow daffodils, and purple pansies). One section is empty dark soil with no plants. Each planted section is 2 feet x 2 feet. A small garden stake in the corner reads '3/4 planted'. Natural outdoor lighting with slight shadows from the plants.
```

**Pi's Starting Question:** "A gardener planted 3 out of 4 sections. What fraction of the garden has flowers?"

**Milestones:**
- Basic (50 pts): Student identifies 3 planted sections and explains as "three fourths"

---

## Card 13: Misconception - Bigger Denominator (Teaching - 100 points)

**Context:** Lunch choices - Pi is confused!  
**Learning Goal:** Correct the misconception that larger denominators mean larger fractions

**Image Prompt:**
```
Side-by-side photograph of two identical whole sandwiches (each 6 inches x 4 inches) on separate white plates. The left sandwich is cut into 3 equal pieces with one piece labeled '1/3'. The right sandwich is cut into 6 equal pieces with one piece labeled '1/6'. Both sandwiches are the same type (turkey and cheese on wheat bread). The 1/3 piece is visibly much larger than the 1/6 piece. The pieces are slightly separated to show clear divisions. Overhead lighting makes the size comparison obvious.
```

**Pi's Starting Question:** "Pi is confused! Pi thinks 1/6 should be bigger than 1/3 because 6 is a bigger number than 3. Can you help Pi understand what's wrong with this thinking?"

**Milestones:**
- Teaching (100 pts): Student teaches Pi about the inverse relationship - more pieces = smaller parts

---

## Card 14: Misconception - Unequal Parts (Teaching - 100 points)

**Context:** Sharing a brownie - Pi made a mistake!  
**Learning Goal:** Understand that fractions REQUIRE equal parts

**Image Prompt:**
```
Top-down photograph of a rectangular brownie (8 inches x 4 inches) on a white plate that has been cut into 4 pieces, but the pieces are NOT equal. The cuts are uneven: one large piece (4 inches x 3 inches), one medium piece (2 inches x 3 inches), and two small pieces (1 inch x 3 inches each). Above the brownie is Pi's avatar with a speech bubble saying: 'Pi cut this into 4 pieces, so each piece is 1/4!' The unequal sizes should be obviously visible. One piece has a label '1/4?' with a question mark. The brownie is chocolate with visible texture. Natural lighting shows the size differences clearly.
```

**Pi's Starting Question:** "Pi cut this brownie into 4 pieces and thinks each piece is 1/4. But something seems wrong. What do you notice?"

**Milestones:**
- Teaching (100 pts): Student explains that fractions require equal parts, not just any division
