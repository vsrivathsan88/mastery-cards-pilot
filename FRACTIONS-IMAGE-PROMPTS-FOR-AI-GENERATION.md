**Purpose:** Size comparison assessment - visual measurement of proportions

### 📋 COMPLETE COPY-PASTE PROMPT

```
[Use Master Design System Prompt above, then add:]

Two rectangular cookie pieces with rounded corners, side-by-side on warm cream background #F5F1E8. MATHEMATICAL EMPHASIS: Clear geometric shapes for size comparison.

LEFT PIECE: Rectangle 180px wide × 120px tall. Tan fill #D4A574. 4px solid border #1A1D2E. 16px rounded corners (cookie-like but geometric). 6px 6px 0 hard offset shadow #1A1D2E (NO BLUR). Five chocolate chips: dark brown #3D2817 circles, EXACTLY 12px diameter each, evenly distributed in a clear pattern (grid-like: 3 across top, 2 across bottom).

RIGHT PIECE: Rectangle 60px wide × 40px tall (EXACTLY 1/3 the dimensions). Same tan fill #D4A574. Same 4px border #1A1D2E. Same 16px rounded corners (proportionally). Same hard offset shadow. Two chocolate chips: SAME 12px diameter, evenly placed.

CRITICAL FOR MATH UNDERSTANDING:
- Chocolate chips are SAME SIZE (12px) on both cookies - this makes the size difference OBVIOUS
- Rectangular shapes with rounded corners (not too organic) - students can visually measure
- Place cookies at SAME vertical centerline (aligned) - makes width comparison clear
- Spacing: 70px horizontal gap between cookies

NO text, NO labels, NO measurement lines. Pure geometric size comparison. Student should visually see: "This one is 3x bigger in width AND height."
```

### Neo-Brutalist Technical Specs
- Canvas: 450px × 280px, #F5F1E8 background
- Large cookie: 180px × 120px rectangle, #D4A574 fill
- Small cookie: 60px × 40px (EXACTLY 1/3 scale)
- Borders: 4px solid #1A1D2E
- Corners: 16px border-radius (structured cookie shape)
- Shadows: 6px 6px 0 #1A1D2E (hard edge, flat)
- Chocolate chips: SAME size (12px) on both - shows proportional difference
- Vertical alignment: Same centerline for clear width comparison

### Mathematical Clarity - KEY IMPROVEMENTS
- **Geometric rectangles** (not irregular) - students can measure visually
- **Same-sized chocolate chips** - proves size difference is in cookie, not random
- **3:1 ratio in BOTH dimensions** - clear proportional relationship
- **Aligned vertically** - makes horizontal comparison obvious
- Students can SEE: "If I stack 3 small cookies, they'd equal 1 large"

Circle with subtle folding strategy hint on warm cream background #F5F1E8. Supportive scaffolding for struggling students.

CIRCLE: 200px diameter, centered. White #FFFFFF fill, 4px border #1A1D2E, 6px 6px 0 shadow #1A1D2E. 

DOTTED LINE: Vertical line through exact center top to bottom, 10px dash 6px gap pattern, 3px stroke #FFB84D (warm orange). Suggests where to fold or draw.

SUBTLE CURVED ARROWS: Two small curved arrows (one on each side), 3px #FFB84D, pointing inward toward center line, suggesting folding motion. Arrows positioned at mid-height (100px from top). 16px arrowheads.

Very subtle alternating fills on left/right semicircles: Left #FFFFFF, Right #F5F1E8 (barely visible, just enough to suggest two halves).

NO text, NO labels, NO instructions. Pure visual hint through dotted line and folding arrows. Student infers the strategy independently.

## 🎯 Production Guidelines

### File Format & Quality
- **Primary format:** SVG (vector, scalable, editable)
- **Alternative:** PNG at 2x resolution (@2x) for retina displays
- **Color space:** sRGB
- **Precision:** Use rulers/grids during generation for exact geometric accuracy
- **Export:** Optimize SVG files (remove unnecessary metadata)

### Neo-Brutalist Color Palette
**This palette is MANDATORY for all 15 images:**

| Color | Hex Code | Usage |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Cream Background | `#F5F1E8` | All canvas backgrounds |
| Pure White | `#FFFFFF` | Shape fills, cards |
| Dark Navy | `#1A1D2E` | All borders, text, division lines |
| Warm Orange | `#FFB84D` | Accents, hints |
| Mint Green | `#7DCCB8` | Success/correct indicators |
| Coral Red | `#FF6B6B` | Error/incorrect indicators |
| Brown-Gray | `#6B6560` | Secondary elements |
| Dark Brown | `#3D2817` | Cookie chips, textures |
| Tan/Cookie | `#D4A574` | Cookie/sandwich fills |

### Neo-Brutalist Design Rules
**MUST FOLLOW:**
1. **Thick borders:** 4px solid #1A1D2E on ALL shapes
2. **Offset shadows:** 6px 6px 0 #1A1D2E (NO blur, hard shadows only)
3. **Rounded corners:** 12-20px border-radius on rectangles/cards
4. **Flat design:** NO gradients, NO soft shadows, NO 3D effects
5. **High contrast:** All text/shapes must meet WCAG AA standards
6. **Bold shapes:** Clean, tactile, geometric precision

### Typography Standards
- **Font:** -apple-system, SF Pro Rounded, system-ui, or similar sans-serif
- **Weights:** 700 (bold) or 800 (extra bold) ONLY
- **Text color:** #1A1D2E (dark navy) always
- **Sizes:** Minimum 14px (prefer 16-24px for readability)
- **Alignment:** Left-aligned, horizontal only

### Mathematical Clarity Principles
**Critical for educational integrity:**
1. **Geometric precision:** Equal parts must be EXACTLY equal (use protractors, rulers)
2. **No leading hints:** Show mathematical structures WITHOUT annotations
3. **Observable differences:** Unequal parts must be OBVIOUSLY unequal (30%+ variance)
4. **Clean negative space:** No clutter, focus on mathematical relationships
5. **Invitation to explore:** Visual design invites questioning, not conclusion-giving

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Contrast ratio:** Minimum 4.5:1 for text (WCAG AA)
- **No color-only info:** Use shapes, borders, and patterns alongside color
- **Readable fonts:** Minimum 14px, bold weights for clarity
- **Alt text:** Provided separately in pedagogy mapping files
- **Clear shapes:** 4px borders ensure visibility for low-vision users

### Batch Generation Workflow

**Step 1:** Copy Master Design System Prompt (from top of document)

**Step 2:** For EACH image, combine Master + Specific prompt:
```
[Paste Master Design System Prompt]

[Paste Specific Image Prompt - e.g., Image 1]
```

**Step 3:** Generate with AI tool of choice:

**Recommended for Gemini 2.5 Flash:**
```
Create educational SVG illustration for grade 3 mathematics.
[paste combined prompt]
Output: SVG format, exact dimensions specified
```

**Recommended for DALL-E 3:**
```
Educational vector illustration, neo-brutalist style
[paste combined prompt]
Flat design, thick borders, offset shadows, warm colors
```

**Recommended for Midjourney:**
```
[paste combined prompt] --style raw --no gradients, soft shadows, 3D effects, photorealism --ar [aspect ratio from dimensions]
```
